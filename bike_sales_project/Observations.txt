Observations :-

1. To summarize, males and females who purchased bike have higher income than those who didn't
   which makes sense. In general, it is seen that males earn more than females.

2. As expected, the middle-aged people purchased more bikes than adolescent or old groups

3. Surprisingly, people who commute 0-1 miles recorded higher purchase count than people who
   travel higher distances. Maybe, people who travel larger distance opted for cars or maybe
   data is not sufficient for categories beyond 0-1 miles.

4. Region wise, Europe has lower incomes recorded compared to others by approx. 15k.

5. There is a huge gap between incomes of females and males with bachelor's degree (approx. 3000k)
   with females earning more than males

6. Purchase count in north america is highest for 2-5 miles category with people having bachelors/graduate degree.

7. People with bachelors degree in Europe recorded highest purchase count.

8. In a nutshell, single people preferred bikes more compared to married people.
   Maybe, married couples prefer cars over bikes.
