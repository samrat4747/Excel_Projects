"Hey,

The board is asking to see how volume looked in Q2. I got some data (attached), but didn’t have a chance to pull anything together and 
was hoping you could take a stab at it.

I think they just want to see Q2 2021 volume by region and wanted to know if everything was looking good. 
I think this file has what you need. I don’t remember all the region codes – I know NAM ends in 1, EMEA ends in 3 and APAC and LATAM are 2 and 4, but 
I don’t remember which is which. I do know LATAM has the lowest volume so just go ahead and assign that to which ever comes out lowest.

I appreciate your help!"
